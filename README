CS138 Final Project
Title: Guided Reinforcement Learning in Poker Using Monte Carlo Tree Search and Deep Q-learning
Authors: Jimmy Maslen and Rob Pitkin

Required libraries/dependencies:
- python
- numpy
- matplotlib
- rlcard
- pytorch
- pickle
- json
- pandas
- pokerlib
- sklearn
- copy

How to run/replicate experiments:
- cd tests
- python run_experiment.py

Change "games_to_play" and "num_hands_per_game" in run_experiment.py
to vary experiment and game length. Change "num_rollouts" to vary the number
of rollouts for MCTS agents playing.
